Welcome to Doc-testing's documentation!
=======================================


Welcome to Doc-testing documentation. 

There's no serious thing here except for:

	Technical Writing testing. 
	So to say it's for learning purpose.

In this testing we're using :ref:`Sphinx <settingup>` as our wrting tool. 

You can clone this repo and add your own text below after the equality signs line. 

Moreso, don't forget to add your name after the added text. 

Don't worry we don't want you to add anything meaning, only for you to be able to add your own formatted text or code snippet.

==== Add your Text (Formatted) here bellow including your name ====


==== Add your Text (Formatted) above here including your name =====

If you have reached to this extent. Congratulations!
You are now ready to contribute to "Open Source" documentation
